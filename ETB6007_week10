###TASK: 
choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it to an R dataframe.

We have signed up for an API key and we are going to work on the API for movie reviews

```{r}
#movie reviews
library(jsonlite)
#API key
my_key <- "&api-key=e7f6c34308ad86a6f139502bdb47991c:5:73331550"

url<-"http://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/all.json?order=by-opening-date"

request <- fromJSON(paste0(url, my_key))
reviews <- request$results
colnames(reviews)
df<-as.data.frame(reviews)
head(df)
```
